These are the data and codes in R accompanying the manuscript: "Towards a system-level causative knowledge of pollinator communities" by Serguei Saavedra, Ignasi Bartomeus, Oscar Godoy, Rudolf P. Rohr, Penguan Zu

The file main.R can be used to run the entire analysis.

The file load_data.R has the information to load the abiotic data (inside abiotic folder) and plant-pollinator matrices (inside matrices folder). Note that these data were compiled in:
(1)  Olesen  JM,  Stefanescu  C,  Traveset  A   (2011)  Strong,  long-term  temporal  dynamics  of  an ecological network. PLoS One6:e26455
(2) Saavedra  S,  Rohr  RP,  Olesen  JM,  Bascompte  J   (2016)  Nested  species  interactions  pro-mote feasibility over stability during the assembly of a pollinator community. Ecology  and Evolution6:997?1007.
(3) Song  C,  Saavedra  S   (2018)  Structural  stability  as  a  consistent  predictor  of  phenological events. Proc. R. Soc. B285:20180767.

The file toolbox. R has additional functions to generate the competition matrices among pollinators and to generate the synthetic data.

The code is commented and self explanatory.
